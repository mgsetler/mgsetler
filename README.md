- 👋 Hi, I’m @mgsetler
- 👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack (Front-End work, and Back-End work) - I am planning on becoming a Software Engineer or Software Developer with experience in both fields with web development
- 🌱 I’m continously learning ... PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap (4, 5, 6), HTML/CSS, MERN (MongoDB, Express, REACT, NODE), MEAN (AngularJS), WordPress
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... front-end projects AND back-end projects.


On the pathway of becoming a Web and App Developer [Full-Stack], planning on growing within IT circles in
Logan, UT as a future Software Engineer with both Back-end and Front-End capabilities.<br />
Sensible, reliable, efficient, and requiring little oversight when it comes to training or tenure. Capable of combining
both creative thinking and critical thinking to conjure practical methods for online use. Described as a "necessary
and powerful force in any workplace" in both the past and the present.<br />
This journey into web development started with once being a freelance writer (self-help, spirituality, contemporary
romance) and a more recent project exposing one to cyber-security literature (having written a 40,000-word primer
for a NIST Cyber-Security Frameworks book series), staying consistent with the straightforward nature of previous
work in call centers and phone agencies with business orientations (customer service, investigative thinking).
